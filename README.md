# Audio features and lyrics analysis 

I decided to visualize audio features and lyrics of one of my favourite artists across his four bands to find out how different or similar the projects are. This is a training project to improve my personal skills. First of all, I wanted to learn how to collect audio features from Spotify's API, then visualize the dataset with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries showing correlations between audio features and popularity scores, finally I als tried to apply machine learning models to cluster the catalogue of songs into four possible groups representing the four differen bands. 

I am also interested in Natural Lanuage Processing, and wanted to find out if there are words or themes representing the four different bands and how these words and themes have changed overtime.

You will find the following notebooks on this repository:

1. Collecting Spotify's audio features from playlists
2. Visual exploration of the dataset
3. Clustering songs 
4. Wordclouds of lyrics and albums 
5. NLP and topics analysis across time

I will then publish a link on my medium account.
