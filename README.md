How to visualize the music and lyrics of your favourite artist? 
And what if your favourite artist happens to have played in four different bands (that you equally loved through the years)? Will machine learning be able to predict the difference between the bands?

For this project, I wanted to learn how to collect audio features from Spotify, visualize the datasets with Matplotlib and Seaborn and show correlations between audio features and popularity scores. I also wanted to challenge machine learning clustering algorithms, and apply natural lanuage processing to find the most representative themes in the lyrics of the four bands and how they have changed through time.

I will be uploading the following notebooks:

1. Spotify's audio features collection
2. Visual exploration of the dataset
3. Clustering songs 
4. Wordclouds of lyrics and albums 
5. NLP and topics analysis across time

Stay tuned!
